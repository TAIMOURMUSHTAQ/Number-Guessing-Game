**Number Guessing Game**

This is a simple **Python console game** where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number between **1 and 100**. After each guess, the game provides hints to help the player reach the correct number.
### 📂 Project Overview

✅ Written in Python 3
✅ Uses `random` module to generate the secret number
✅ Validates user input with `try-except` for error handling
✅ Tracks number of guesses
✅ Provides feedback after each attempt

### 💻 How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python installed. You can download it from:  
   [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Clone the repository or download the `.py` file.

3. Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
python guess_the_number.py
```

> Replace `guess_the_number.py` with your actual file name if it's different.

### 🧠 Game Logic
1- A random number between **1 and 100** is generated.
2- The player keeps guessing until they match the number.
3- The program gives hints like:
4- `"Too low try higher number..."`
5- `"Too high try lower number..."`
6- The total number of attempts is shown when the correct guess is made.

### ⚙️ Features to Add (Optional)
1- Limit the number of attempts (e.g., 10 tries)
2- High score tracking
3- Difficulty levels (easy/medium/hard)
4- GUI version using Tkinter

### 📄 Sample Output

```
Guess a number between 1 and 100: 50
Too high try lower number...
Guess again: 30
Too low try higher number...
Guess again: 40
You got the number 40 at 3 guesses
```
